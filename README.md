# Anti-Feminism

The women were always abusive in general. Then came feminism and it got even worse. So now, let us hope, that this is the start of an anti-feminism movement that gives back at least EQUALITY.

First ideas:
- Just treat them the way they do you. If men as a collective refuse to interact with women, they lose power. If they are not hired, they lose power. If they are isolated and excluded, they lose power.
